Instructions:

This script is a Git pre-commit hook that spell checks any content you are about to commit.

Place this script into the ".git/hooks/" directory in your repository. It must be called "pre-commit" and be executable. A Git hook only works in a single repository. You need to copy this hook into every repository you wish to use it in manually. Optionally, you can set up a symlink in the ".git/hooks/" directory pointing to the script.

Each time you try to commit something, this script is run and spell checks the content you are committing.

Should you want to bypass the pre-commit hook (though not recommended), you can commit with "git commit --no-verify".


TODO:

1. Use printf instead of echo.

2. Global/Local dictionary for ignored words?
